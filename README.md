Bytecode Outline Plug-in for Eclipse

**Note**: in 2023 code was moved to [JDT UI](https://github.com/eclipse-jdt/eclipse.jdt.ui/tree/master/org.eclipse.jdt.bcoview) repository 
and Bytecode view included in the default SDK package (starting with 4.27).

Bugs should be reported at https://github.com/eclipse-jdt/eclipse.jdt.ui/issues.

Once 4.27 will be released, the bundle will be available for installation in other packages via https://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/updates/latest/.

The source code exists to allow inspecting original code changes history.
